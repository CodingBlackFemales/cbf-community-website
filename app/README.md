## <a name='About'></a>1. About

This project is a redesign of the [Coding Black Females](https://codingblackfemales.com) website, using React (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)).

- node version: 12.13.0
- npm version: 6.12.0 or above

## <a name='AvailableScripts'></a>2. Available Scripts

In the project, you can run:

#### <a name='npmstart'></a>2.1. `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### <a name='npmrunbuild'></a>2.2. `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` directory. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. The app will also be ready to deploy. [View docs about deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

#### <a name='npmtest'></a>2.3. `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

#### <a name='npmruntest:coverage'></a>2.4. `npm run test:coverage`

Launches the test runner, displaying the test coverage.<br />

#### <a name='npmruntest:no-watch'></a>2.5. `npm run test:no-watch`

Launches the test runner _without_ the interactive watch mode.<br />

#### <a name='npmrunstorybook'></a>2.6. `npm run storybook`

Runs Storybook in development mode. Open [http://localhost:9009/](http://localhost:9009/) to view it in the browser. [What is Storybook?](#Storybook)

#### <a name='npmrunstorybook:build'></a>2.7. `npm run storybook:build`

This will build the storybook configured in the Storybook directory into a static web app and place it inside the `.out` directory. You can deploy the content in the `.out` directory wherever you want.

To test it locally, run `npx http-server .out`

[What is Storybook?](#Storybook)

#### <a name='npmrunlint'></a>2.8. `npm run lint`

Tests for linting errors in the codebase.

#### <a name='npmrunlint:fix'></a>2.9. `npm run lint:fix`

Fixes linting and code formatting errors in the codebase.

## <a name='DirectoryStructure'></a>3. Directory Structure

### <a name='srcDirectoryStructure'></a>3.1. src Directory Structure

```
ðŸ“¦src
 â”£ ðŸ“‚App
 â”£ ðŸ“‚shared
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚atoms
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚molecules
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚organisms
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚utils
```

- The `src` directory consists of the `shared` folder, and separate folders for larger components, such as the `App` component.<br/><br/>

#### <a name='ComponentDirectory'></a>3.1.1. Component Directory

e.g. The `App` directory

```
App
 â”£ __tests__
 â”ƒ â”£ __snapshots__
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— index.test.js.snap
 â”ƒ â”— index.test.js
 â”£ App.stories.jsx
 â”— index.jsx
```

- `index.jsx` contains the component.
- `App.stories.jsx` is the storybook file for the component.
- `__tests__` contains the unit tests for the component, and the directory `__snapshots__`, which is automatically generated by snapshot tests.

- The main components are contained within the `src` directory. An example of this is the `App` directory.<br/><br/>

#### <a name='Shareddirectory'></a>3.1.2. Shared directory

- The `shared` directory contains `components` and `utils`.

##### 3.1.2.1. `/components`

```
components
 â”£ atoms
 â”£ molecules
 â”— organisms
```

Shared components are components which are used within a variety of others. Each of the folders below, contain subfolders of components. [An example of a component directory](#ComponentDirectory).

- `atoms` - icontains basic HTML elements like headers, form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further.
- `molecules` - contains atoms combined together to create a component.
- `organisms` - contains atoms and molecules combined to create a component.<br/><br/>

##### 3.1.2.2. `/utils`

Contains helper functions, which can be reused across the codebase.

---

## <a name='Tests'></a>4. Tests

### <a name='UnitTests'></a>4.1. Unit Tests

The following libraries are used for unit testing:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

The tests are located in the `/__tests__` directory, within each component directory and the `/shared/utils` directory. Where possible, each component and helper function should be tested.

To run the tests and test coverage report, check the [available scripts section](#AvailableScripts).

---

## <a name='Storybook'></a>5. Storybook

[Storybook Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/)

Storybook allows you to create components, and showcase them in an isolated development environment. This is done by creating `**.stories.jsx` files within each component directory.

To run Storybook, check the [available scripts section](#AvailableScripts).

---

## <a name='Linting'></a>6. Linting

The linter used is [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), along with the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/) code formatter.

To run the linter, check the [available scripts section](#AvailableScripts).

---

## <a name='StyledComponentsandCSS'></a>7. Styled Components and CSS

CSS is handled using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs), which allows the CSS for each component to be contained within the same file.

The root directory contains `index.css`.

---

## <a name='Pre-commitPre-PushChecks'></a>8. Pre-commit & Pre-Push Checks

The following checks are automatically triggered by [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky), upon actioning `git commit` and `git push`.

- Pre-commit: `npm run lint:fix` & `git add` to fix lint errors. To add a WIP (work in progress) commit, use the following `git commit --no-verify`.

- Pre-push: `npm run test --watchAll=false` is run before actioning the push. If there are failing tests, the push will fail. Fix the tests, and try again.
